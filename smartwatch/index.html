        This project was inspired by the release of the original Moto 360. It was
        also an exercise in Android development and using Bluetooth to communicate
        between devices. I had originally planned it as about a month long project
        but it has gone on a lot longer than I originally thought (as projects tend
        to do).

        It has still not been completed, although the first iteration is done and I am
        taking a break from it so that I can spend more time on other projects.
        Ultimately it came down to the fact that the hardware available to
        consumers for making things like this just isn't small enough to create
        a piece of wearble tech that could confortably fit on a wrist. I was able to make a
        device that functionally read notifications from my phone and display the
        time, but it is about 14mm thick, much to large to be confortable worn on
        the wrist.
      </p>
      <p class="project-body-text">
        I did throughout the process make some changes in an attempt at making the device
        more compact. The first of these was to swap the Arduino Pro Min for and Adafruit
        Pro Trinket. The advantage here was that I no longer had to deal with using an
        FTDI controller for interfacing with the device. This also made charging much more
        convienent with the advent of a small LiPo battery. Adafruit sells a great charge
        control board that fits perfectly with the Trinket.

      <p class="project-body-text">
        Also, another issue I have yet to resolve is how to control the watch. I am
        attempting to make the interface as minimal as possible. This means there is very
        little need for an sort of hardware buttons. Unfortunately, I do still need a way
        to turn the device on and off. And because serial communication is used to both
        upload code to the Trinket and trasmit data through the Bluetooth module, I need
        to be able to turn the BT module off when uploading code. Thus I have two large switches
        tethered to the device still (one is almost as large as all the other parts combined).
        This is an incredibly simple fix, I simply need to buy a small dip switch for both
        controls, but I haven't gotten around to it, mainly due to a scarcity of parts (those
        switches were the only two I had on hand).

      <p class="project-body-text">
        Moving forward I would like to CAD a custom PCB and have it manufactured
        for me as I do not have the tools available to make something on such a
        small scale. This would allow for all of the hardware function without
        extraneous bits (for instance I have no need for most of the functionallity
        on the Trinket, I could instead simply use the ATmega328 on its own).
