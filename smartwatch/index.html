        This project was inspired by the release of the original Moto 360. It was
        also an exercise in Android development and using Bluetooth to communicate
        between devices. I had originally planned it as about a month long project
        but it has gone on a lot longer than I originally thought (as projects tend
        to do).

        It has still not been completed, although the first iteration is done and I am
        taking a break from it so that I can spend more time on other projects.
        Ultimately it came down to the fact that the hardware available to
        consumers for making things like this just isn't small enough to create
        a piece of wearble tech that could confortably fit on a wrist. I was able to make a
        device that functionally read notifications from my phone and display the
        time, but it is about 14mm thick, much to large to be confortable worn on
        the wrist.

        Moving forward I would like to CAD a custom PCB and have it manufactured
